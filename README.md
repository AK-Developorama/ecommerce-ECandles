### Intro

My goal was to help out a client and her sustainable candle business, using both React and the Shopify API.

So I have created a private Shopify app and linked my React project to it thru the API and Shopify buy package.

### Live Site

Hosted on Heroku: https://earthfriend-candles.herokuapp.com/

### Dependencies

chakra ui

shopify buy

material ui

react icons 

bootstrap

react router dom 

I used EmailJS, React-Toastify, and React-Hook-Form to build the contact form. No backend needed, EmailJS sends emails from the contact form straight to the client.
