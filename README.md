### Overview

My goal was to help out a friend and client to start her online sustainable candle business.

I used React and the Shopify API to achieve this.

By creating a private Shopify app, I linked it to my React project thru the API and Shopify buy package.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### The challenge


I used EmailJS, React-Toastify, and React-Hook-Form to build the contact form.

No backend needed, EmailJS sends emails from the contact form straight to the client.


Users should be able to:

- browse the candle images and see the scents in the carousel
- add items to the basket that are saved to local storage
- check out and pay thru the typical shopify payment page
