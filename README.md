--- Intro ---

My goal was to help out a client and her sustainable candle business, using both React and the Shopify API.

So I have created a private Shopify app and linked my React project to it thru the API and Shopify buy package.

--- Dependencies ---

shopify buy

react-responsive-carousel

react router dom 

emailjs

react-hook-form

react-toastify

react-scroll-up

styling: chakra ui, material ui, react icons, bootstrap


I used EmailJS, React-Toastify, and React-Hook-Form to build the contact form. 

No backend needed, EmailJS sends emails from the contact form straight to the client.
