        text={`Vegetable-based, the wax in our soy candles comes from soybean oil, ensuring theyâ€™re free of potentially toxic chemicals such as ones found in paraffin. Producing a slow burn with no residue or sooty smokiness thanks to their cotton wicks, ECs tend to last longer too.

'Our UK soy is a naturally sourced, eco-friendly ingredient, and without the addition of synthetic chemicals, these candles are better for your lungs. They are also vegan, unlike other candles that contain beesewax, for example. And as their scent comes from essential oils, it can be a purer blend, meaning these candles deliver long-lasting fragrance.'   (The Independent)
