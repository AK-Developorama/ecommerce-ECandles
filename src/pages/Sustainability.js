        text={`Vegetable-based, the wax in our soy candles comes from soybean oil, ensuring theyâ€™re free of potentially toxic chemicals such as ones found in paraffin. Producing a slow burn with no residue or sooty smokiness thanks to their cotton wicks, ECs tend to last longer too.

'Our UK soy is a naturally sourced, eco-friendly ingredient, and without the addition of synthetic chemicals, these candles are better for your lungs. And as their scent comes from essential oils, it can be a purer blend, meaning these candles deliver long-lasting fragrance.'   (The Independent)
